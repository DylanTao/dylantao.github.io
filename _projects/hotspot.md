description: a new optimization framework for neural signed distance functions (SDFs) by solving a screened Poisson equation that provides an asymptotically sufficient conditionâ€”ensuring the output converges to the true distance function, unlike prior methods like the Eikonal loss which are necessary but insufficient; the method improves stability, penalizes surface area naturally, and achieves superior surface reconstruction across 2D and 3D datasets
