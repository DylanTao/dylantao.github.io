Hello visitor, Sirui (pronounced as "three") here!👋 I am a master's student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California San Diego. My broad research interest lies in leveraging technological advancements to better augment human capabilities in all areas.

Currently, my four main research interests are (listed in order of my passion for each topic):

1. **HCI and Design**
2. **Embodied (semi-)Autonomous Systems in the Wild**
3. **AI and Mixed Reality for People with Disabilities**
4. **Human-in-the-loop AI Solutions in Real World**

More specifically:

1. Enabling creative professionals 👨‍🎨 to leverage AI tools 🧠 for their design tasks 🖼️, from both Human-Computer Interaction and Computer Graphics perspectives.
2. Studying how to smoothly incorporate embodied (semi-)autonomous systems 🤖 into people's everyday lives.
3. Using AI and Mixed Reality to help blind and low-vision individuals live more enjoyable and independent lives 😎.
4. Monitoring and iteratively improving the deployment of the above mentioned AI solutions in the real world 🌍 to maximize benefits while minimizing harm.

Additionally, I am open to explore:

- Scaling affordable and accessible learning resources for all with customized and engaging interactions enabled by learner-centric generative AI.
- Creating more inclusive and effective support for community-centered work, enabled by the emergence of AI advancements.

Currently, I am working on research projects under the guidance of [Prof. Steven Dow](https://spdow.ucsd.edu/) on HCI and [Prof. Tzu-Mao Li](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/) on Graphics. During my undergraduate studies, I had the great fortune to work with [Prof. Judith E. Fan](https://profiles.stanford.edu/judith-fan) on Intuitive physics.
