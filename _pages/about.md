Hello visitor, Sirui here! 👋 (pronounced like “three”)

I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the Cognitive Science Department at UC San Diego, advised by [Prof. Steven P. Dow](https://spdow.ucsd.edu/) ([ProtoLab](https://protolab.ucsd.edu/)). I build tools that **augment human capabilities**—especially how people **think, design, and make**—using human-centered AI and mixed reality. ⚡

**Research Focus (2025)**

- **Human–AI for Design** 🧠🎨 — Interfaces that keep generative alternatives diverse, legible, and verifiable through structured variation and aligned comparison.
- **AI & Mixed Reality for Augmentation** 🥽📐 — In-situ support for everyday tasks with accessibility focus and spatial intelligence beyond demo rooms.
- **Method** 🧪 — Build → measure: controlled variation, mixed-methods evaluation, and metrics for diversity, verification cost, and appropriate reliance.

**Domains I Love Applying This To**

- Urban design, architecture, interior & product design, fashion, robotics, accessibility, and education tech—places where ideas move from **vibes → variables → value**. ✨

**Additionally Exploring**

- Embodied systems 🤖 integration into everyday life
- Post-deployment iteration 🌍 to maximize benefit and minimize harm
- Accessible learning at scale 📚 with learner-centric generative AI
- Community-centered tools 🤝 for real-world collaboration

**Research Opportunities @ ProtoLab** 🧪

Seeking curious, motivated, and kind undergraduate & master's students to work with! Whether you're just starting your academic journey or nearing graduation, I'm happy to work with and mentor students from all years and departments.

I broadly categorize potential interns into two bins—though you're welcome to explore both!

- **Quant** 🧩 (coding/ML/AR-VR/metrics) — Building interfaces (React/TS), XR interactions (Unity/C#), graphics/vision, LLM/VLM pipelines, and data analysis (Python/pandas/matplotlib), plus designing metrics.

- **Quali** ✍️ (UI/UX/interviews/analysis) — Designing user flows and interfaces (Figma), running user studies and interviews, analyzing qualitative data, and creating clear visualizations and reports.

**Ready to apply?** Email me (s1tao@ucsd.edu) with subject **"UCSD Research – Quant / Quali / Both"** and include: a **1-page CV/resumé** or portfolio link 🔗, plus a **3–5 sentence TL;DR** on why you're a fit (interests, skills, what you want to learn) 📨

I’m happy to chat once I have that quick snapshot!

**Advisor Lineage & Past Collaborations**

- Ph.D.: **[Steven P. Dow](https://spdow.ucsd.edu/)** (HCI)
- Master's: **[Steven P. Dow](https://spdow.ucsd.edu/)** (HCI) & **[Tzu-Mao Li](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/)** (Graphics)
- Undergrad: **[Judith E. Fan](https://profiles.stanford.edu/judith-fan)** (Cognition & Intuitive Physics)
