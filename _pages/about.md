Hello Visitor, Sirui here!👋 I am a master's student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego. My broad research interest lies in leveraging technological advancements to better augment human capabilities in all areas.

Currently, my three main research interests are (listed in order of my passion for each topic):

1. **HCI + Design**
2. **Embodied (semi-)autonomous Systems in the Wild**
3. **AI and Mixed Reality for People with Disabilities**

More Specifically, I am Interested In:

1. Enabling creative professionals 👨‍🎨 to leverage AI tools 🧠 for their design tasks 🖼️, from both Human-Computer Interaction and Computer Graphics perspectives.
2. Studying how to smoothly incorporate embodied (semi-)autonomous systems 🤖 into people's everyday lives.
3. Using AI and Mixed Reality to help blind and low-vision individuals live more enjoyable and independent lives 😎.

Additionally, I am Open to Exploring:

- How we can maximize benefits while minimizing harm when new AI solutions are deployed in the real world.
  This includes:
  - Using well-designed metrics to monitor and measure outcomes as vast amounts of information stream in.
  - Keeping humans in the loop to iteratively improve the process.
- Providing more customized and effective learning resources and interactions while making them more affordable and accessible to people.
- Creating more inclusive and effective community work support, enabled by the emergence of AI advancements.

Currently, I am working on research projects under the guidance of [Prof. Steven Dow](https://spdow.ucsd.edu/) on HCI and [Prof. Tzu-Mao Li](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/) on Graphics. During my undergraduate studies, I had the great fortune to work with [Prof. Judith E. Fan](https://profiles.stanford.edu/judith-fan) on Intuitive physics.
