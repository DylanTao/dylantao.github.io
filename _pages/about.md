Hello visitor, Sirui here. I am a CSE master student at University of California San Diego. My research interest lays in better enabling creative professionals to use AI tools for their design tasks, both from Human-Computer Interaction and Computer Graphics perspectives. In my current master study, I am working on some interesting research projects under the guidance of [Prof. Steven Dow](https://spdow.ucsd.edu/) on HCI and [Prof. Tzu-mao Li](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/) on graphics. During my undergraduate study, I had the great fortunate to work with [Prof. Judith E. Fan](https://profiles.stanford.edu/judith-fan).
