Hello visitor, Sirui Tao here. I am a CSE master student at University of California San Diego (UCSD). My research interest lays in better enabling creative professionals to use AI tools for their design tasks, both from Computer Graphics (CG) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) perspectives. In my current master study, I am working on some interesting research projects under the guidance of [Prof. Tzu-mao Li](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/) on graphics and [Prof. Steven Dow](https://spdow.ucsd.edu/) on HCI. During my undergraduate study, I had the great fortunate to work [Prof. Judith E. Fan](https://profiles.stanford.edu/judith-fan).
