I'm excited to announce that I'll be starting my pottery journey this fall quarter at the UCSD Craft Center, learning from the amazing **[Ellen Fager](https://www.sandiegopottersguild.org/ellen-fager.html)**!

Ellen is a member of the [San Diego Potters' Guild](https://www.sandiegopottersguild.org) and teaches classes there.

## How I Discovered Ellen's Work

Last year at the Craft Center Fair, I saw Ellen's booth and fell in love with her piglet artwork. I had to buy it! That piece got me excited about pottery, so when I found out she teaches classes, I signed up right away.

## My First Three Commissioned Works (Design Drafts)

I have three pieces commissioned that I'm excited to create. These are my design drafts - the actual pottery pieces will be made during my pottery journey with Ellen Fager:

### 1. Psyduck Coffee Cup

A fun and quirky coffee cup featuring everyone's favorite confused Pok√©mon, Psyduck. This will be a functional piece that brings joy to morning coffee routines. _(Design draft - not yet produced)_

### 2. Winnie the Pooh Pot with Lid

A charming honey pot inspired by the beloved bear, complete with a bear-head lid. This piece will be both decorative and functional, perfect for storing honey or other sweet treats. _(Design draft - not yet produced)_

### 3. Cat Sculpture Pair

Two small cat sculptures - one dancing with joy and another peacefully sleeping. These will showcase different moods and poses, adding personality to any space. _(Design draft - not yet produced)_

## Stay Tuned

I'll definitely share updates as I go along and show you the finished pieces when they're done. Right now these are just my design ideas - the fun part starts when I actually get to work with the clay!

_Note: These are design drafts and concepts - the actual pottery pieces will be created during my pottery journey with Ellen Fager. The images shown are design renderings, not finished pottery._
