# Website Design Heuristics

Use this file as the shared design memory for future homepage and portfolio refinements. The goal is a personal academic site that feels thoughtful, alive, and readable without becoming a corporate product site or a visual demo reel.

## First-Glance Story

- A rushed visitor should learn, within 15-30 seconds: who Sirui is, what problem space he studies, what he has built, why it matters, and where to click next.
- Lead with the research thesis, not with a long biography.
- Every section should answer one visitor question:
  - Start: Who is this?
  - Taste: What is the intellectual thread?
  - Focus: What are the research areas?
  - Work: What concrete artifacts prove it?
  - Updates: What is active now?
  - Students: How can someone work with Sirui?
  - Connect: How can someone follow up?

## Visual Hierarchy

- One dominant headline per viewport is enough.
- Use section labels for scanning, but keep them quiet and consistent.
- Prefer fewer, stronger CTAs over many equal buttons.
- Put proof close to claims: projects, publications, venue labels, and updates should appear near the research story they support.
- Use whitespace to clarify grouping, not to create empty drama.

## Color

- Orange is the primary action and identity accent.
- Mint and sky should be semantic highlights, used sparingly for contrast or a specific idea.
- Neutral surfaces should carry most of the layout.
- Avoid a page that reads as all orange, all pastel, all purple, or all gradient.
- If color does not communicate hierarchy, state, or meaning, remove it.

## Project Images

- Research teaser figures must remain inspectable.
- Do not crop diagrams or teaser figures into decorative ratios.
- Use `object-fit: contain` for project previews unless the source image is clearly photographic and safe to crop.
- Use clean white preview wells for figures so diagram backgrounds remain legible.
- If a teaser is unusually wide or tall, add an image aspect hint in page frontmatter instead of forcing every project into the same crop.

## Motion

- Motion should explain the page, not decorate it.
- Good motion: section reveal, active rail state, hover feedback, and small transitions that show "this is clickable."
- Bad motion: constant ambient movement, unrelated loops, or effects that compete with reading.
- Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Animation should make Sirui feel thoughtful and dynamic, not flashy.

## Navigation

- Keep the global nav simple.
- Use in-page navigation only when it helps a reader understand the story structure.
- Desktop can support a compact story rail; mobile should stay clean and linear.
- Anchor links must land with enough top spacing below the fixed nav.
- Active navigation state should match the section currently being read.

## Content

- Keep Sirui's voice warm and specific.
- Avoid generic AI/design language unless it is tied to a concrete research question or project.
- The AI in Design 2026 report is useful as context: it frames AI as changing tools, craft, and teams. Borrow the questions, not the corporate tone.
- A compact influence note can credit Katie Dill and AI in Design 2026, including the line: "AI is sparking a creative renaissance in design."
- Keep the main page centered on Sirui's work, not on external inspiration.

## Accessibility And Quality Checks

- Check light mode, dark mode, mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Check keyboard navigation and visible focus.
- Check that text does not overlap cards, nav, footer, or the back-to-top button.
- Check that mobile has no horizontal overflow.
- Check that colors have enough contrast, especially orange text on light backgrounds and nav text in dark mode.
- Check that reduced-motion users can still see all content.

## Screenshot Critique Ritual

For each meaningful homepage iteration:

1. Capture desktop, tablet, and mobile screenshots.
2. Read the page as a rushed research peer.
3. Read it as a prospective student.
4. Read it as a returning collaborator.
5. Mark anything that is visually loud but not meaningful.
6. Mark anything important that is hard to notice.
7. Revise until the page is clearer, not merely prettier.

## Conservative Inspiration Boundaries

- Stripe is useful for hierarchy, modular proof cards, CTA restraint, and strong sequencing.
- Do not copy Stripe's company-site goals, heavy sales posture, or brand spectacle.
- AI in Design 2026 is useful for framing the moment: infinite output, craft, taste, tool fluency, role blur, and messy collaboration.
- The site should remain a personal academic portfolio with research credibility first.
